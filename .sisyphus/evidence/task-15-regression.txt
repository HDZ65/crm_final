=== CONCLUSION ===
PARTIAL PASS - service-logistics fully passes, service-commercial has entity initialization issue

The regression test failure in service-commercial is NOT related to subscription/fulfillment flow.
It's a pre-existing issue in the tarification (pricing) domain with entity circular dependencies.
The subscription, WooCommerce, and fulfillment tests all pass successfully.

RECOMMENDATION: Fix entity initialization order in ProduitEntity/PrixProduitEntity before production.
