## [2026-02-05T16:30:00] Task 0 Blocker - Pre-existing Build Issue
Session: ses_3d17c51e0ffe7Mz36rOQk10CvK

### Issue
Cannot verify baseline builds due to missing proto package exports.

### Root Cause
- `packages/proto/gen/ts/index.ts` not generated by buf
- Services cannot import from @crm/proto

### Impact
- Cannot establish baseline builds before cleanup
- Cannot verify "build + lint" acceptance criteria after cleanup

### Decision
Proceed with cleanup anyway because:
1. No code imports from proto/generated (verified with grep)
2. Cleanup is safe - removing unused dead code
3. Build issue is pre-existing, not caused by cleanup

### Workaround
- Skip build verification in Tasks 1-4
- Document that builds were already broken
- Task 5 will need proto package fix to complete
